The musicwebapp.js file demonstrates obtaining a Spotify API access token and making a request to get data about a track.

In order to run this, you must first install an IDE for javascript, then it is neessary to create a Spotify account in order to generate access tokens. The directions for how to do this can be found on the official Spotify website:

After replacing the clientID and redirectURI, the program should properly compile and run.
